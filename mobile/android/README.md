# Android Gate Client
> This app was tested on `Android Studio Chipmunk | 2021.2.1 Patch 2`

## Get Started
After cloning the repository, navigate to `/clients/android/` and rename the file `secrets.properties.example` to just `secrets.properties` and replace its content with your own data.

After setting the `secrets.properties` file, all the is left is to open Android Studio and open an existing project. Just locate the `/clients/android` directory and Android Studio should reconize it (the project's root directory) as an Android Studio project. All dependencies will be installed automatically when the project is opened for the first time.
